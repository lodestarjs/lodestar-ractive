Lodestar-Ractive
==
_A combination of the [LodestarJS-Router](https://github.com/lodestarjs/lodestar-router) and [RactiveJS](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) in one place as a proof of concept, presented as a framework._

### What is Lodestar-Ractive?

Lodestar-Ractive provides you with a light, quick and simple way of using a JavaScript framework in your project. It makes use of the Router and general structure provided by LodeStar and the Models and Views provided by Ractive.

I created it as a proof of concept to see how easy it would be to bring two projects like these together to create a simple but powerful framework.
